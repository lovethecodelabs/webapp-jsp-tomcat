# webapp-jsp-tomcat
This website was build using Java/JSP/Tomcat &amp; a MySQL database. It uses the MVC Pardigm to organize programming into Model-View-Controller pages. Using Java to power websites separates the Business Logic from the Style and Appearance of the website. A full application was written in Java and was united with a full html5/css3 design. The resulting website allows for not only performance and aethetics, but a way for the programming to be reused on each page, as well.

Tomcat 8.5 runs these JSP code files in https://matthews.business/ well.
